        <p>I took this photo on a trip in October, 2016. We drove through Thermal, California on the way to the <a
            href="https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=639">Salton Sea State Recreation Area</a>. It might have been the
          long
          way around, but we arrived eventually. I took this photograph because I liked the juxtaposition of the stucco
          buildings&mdash;buit to last in the California heat&mdash; and the spray-painted message informing passers by
          this was the spot local fighters used to train.
