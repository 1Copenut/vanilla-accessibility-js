        <p>Thermal Boxing Club, 2016</p>
        <p>I took this photo on a trip in October, 2016. We drove through
          Thermal, California on the way to the <a href="https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=639">Salton Sea State
            Recreation Area</a>. It might have been the
          long
          way around, but we arrived eventually. I liked the juxtaposition of the stucco
          buildings&mdash;built to last in the California heat&mdash;and the spray-painted message informing passers by
          this was the spot for local fighters wanting to train.
