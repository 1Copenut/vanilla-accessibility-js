# Accessible Mockups Using Vanilla JS

**Why another vanilla JS repo?**<br/>Sometimes it's easier to write accessible front-ends in vanilla JS, then refactor for libraries like React, Svelte, or Vue.

## What this repo is

This repo is an ongoing experiment in discrete, accessible components. Each directory (folder) is a complete component. This includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Support for ES6 and ESModules are assumed.

## What this repo is not

This repo **is not** production-ready code. These components are proofs-of-concept only. If they warrant further exploration, I will move the components into my [webComponentsA11y](https://github.com/1Copenut/webComponentsA11y) or [react-bytes](https://github.com/1Copenut/react-bytes) repositories.
