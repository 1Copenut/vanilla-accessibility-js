# Accessible Mockups Using Vanilla JS

**Why another vanilla JS repo?**<br/>Sometimes it's easier to write accessible front-ends in vanilla JS, then refactor for libraries like React, Svelte, or Vue.

## What this repo is

This repo is an ongoing experiment in discrete, accessible components. Each directory (folder) is a complete component. This includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Support for ES6 and ESModules are assumed.

## What this repo is not

This repo **is not** production-ready code. These components are proofs-of-concept only. If they warrant further exploration, I will move the components into my [webComponentsA11y](https://github.com/1Copenut/webComponentsA11y) or [react-bytes](https://github.com/1Copenut/react-bytes) repositories.

## Getting started
Each directory is its own self-contained experiment. To get started, I assume a couple of things:

1. You have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
2. You're comfortable with the command line

If both of these are true, [clone the vanilla-accessibility-js repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to your local machine, and change into the `vanilla-accessibility-js` directory. Then change into the directory of the experiment you want to test. I'm using `figure-figcaption` for these sample instructions. The ` $ ` should not be typed, that's just how I note the Terminal prompt.

1. `$ cd figure-figcaption`
1. `$ npm install`
1. `$ npm run start`
1. Open a browser window and type in `localhost:8080` or `127.0.0.1:8080`
1. Test as needed
