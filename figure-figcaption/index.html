          <p>Thermal Boxing Club, 2016</p>
          <p>I took this photo on a trip in October, 2016. We drove through Thermal, California on the way to the <a
              href="https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=639">Salton Sea State Recreation Area</a>. It might have been the
            long way around, but we arrived eventually. I liked the juxtaposition of the stucco buildings&mdash;built to
            last in the California heat&mdash;and the spray-painted message informing passers by this was the spot for
            local fighters wanting to train.
