    <p>There will be two versions now, one that uses text only, one that uses the <code>details</code> and
      <code>summary</code> components.

          <p>Thermal Boxing Club, 2016</p>
          <p>I took this photo on a trip in October, 2016. We drove through Thermal, California on the way to the <a
              href="https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=639">Salton Sea State Recreation Area</a>. It might have been the
            long way around, but we arrived eventually. I liked the juxtaposition of the stucco buildings&mdash;built to
            last in the California heat&mdash;and the spray-painted message informing passers by this was the spot for
            local fighters wanting to train.

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Safari + VO only announces the <code>summary</code> text. The <code>details</code> must be expanded to hear
          the rest of the information read out. It still announces as a "figure" but there feels like information is
          missing.</li>
        <li>Firefox + VO doesn't announce as a "figure" at all. It reads out the image alt text and then I have to
          traverse to the details accordion to unfurl the additional information.</li>
